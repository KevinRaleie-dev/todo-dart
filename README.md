# Terminal To-do

A small terminal todo application made with the dart programming language

### How to run:

```dart

    dart main.dart
```

runs the application in the terminal. You'll have a list of options to choose from in order to:

1. add a todo
2. edit a todo
3. list all the todos
4. delete a todo
5. exit the program

Its pretty intuitive to use, all the instructions on what you need to do are all displayed in the terminal.

PS: I built this to learn a bit about the dart programming language.
